# SeekHub

A project which aims at exploring github in search of links between users.

You can run it on your navigator from your local file system, you're just missing the file token.js which is a one-liner saying 

```sh
const TOKEN = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
```

It is the token used to make requests to github.com. The rate of requests is limited so you are invited to get your own github token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), it only takes a minute.

The code is tested on Firefox.
