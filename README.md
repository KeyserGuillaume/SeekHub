# SeekHub

A project which aims at exploring github in search of links between users.

If the gitHub rate limit has been exceeded, you can run it on your local file system once you've changed the file token.js with a token you can create [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), it only takes a minute.

The code is tested on Firefox.
